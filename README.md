# gradle-butler-plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mini2Dx/gradle-butler-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mini2Dx/gradle-butler-plugin)

A gradle plugin for automatically installing, updating and running the [itch.io butler command line tool](https://docs.itch.ovh/butler/master/) as part of your build.


## How to use

Add the following buildscript configuration to the top of your build.gradle

```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath group: 'org.mini2Dx', name: 'butler', version: '1.1.2'
    }
}
```

Then add the plugin configuration to your project.

```gradle
project(":projectName") {
   apply plugin: "org.mini2Dx.butler"
   
   ........

   butler {
      user = "your-itchio-user"
      game = "your-itchio-game"
   
      windows {
         binDirectory = "C:\\path\to\game\bin\directory"
      }
      osx {
         binDirectory = "/path/to/game/bin/directory"
      }
      linux {
         binDirectory = "/path/to/game/bin/directory"
      }
      //Use this if your build will work on any OS, e.g. HTML5 games
      anyOs {
      	 binDirectory = "C:\\path\to\game\bin\directory"
      }
   }
}
```

The plugin will add the following tasks to your project.

| Task  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| butlerUpdate  | Updates butler to latest stable version or installs it if it is not present. All other tasks depend on this task so you do not need to call it explicitly. |
| butlerLogin  | Calls ```butler login``` |
| butlerLogout  | Calls ```butler logout``` |
| butlerPush  | [Pushes builds](https://docs.itch.ovh/butler/master/pushing.html) using butler |

The butlerPush task supports pushing platform-specific and cross-platform builds simultaneously.

For platform-specific builds, the [channel](https://docs.itch.ovh/butler/master/pushing.html#channel-names) is chosen based on the current OS. This can be overridden in the platform configuration. However, to push a release of your game for a platform you must run the task on that platform, i.e. You must be on Mac OS X to push a Mac game release.

For cross-platform builds (e.g. HTML5 games), the ```anyOs``` configuration can be used to specify the channel.

## Advanced Configuration

There are several optional configuration parameters available.

| Option  | Type | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| user  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) Your itch.io username |
| game  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) The itch.io game id |
| updateButler  | boolean | true | Set to false to disable butler updates |
| alphaChannel  | boolean | false | When true appends -alpha to the channel name |
| betaChannel  | boolean | false |  When true appends -beta to channel name |
| userVersion  | String | null | Set this if you want to override itch.io's version number |
| windows.butlerInstallDirectory  | String | null | Set if you want to override the automatic Butler install directory on Windows |
| windows.binDirectory  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) The directory of your game's Windows build |
| windows.channel  | String | "windows" | The channel to release the Windows build to |
| osx.butlerInstallDirectory  | String | null | Set if you want to override the automatic Butler install directory on OS X |
| osx.binDirectory  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) The directory of your game's OS X build |
| osx.channel  | String | "osx" | The channel to release the OS X build to |
| linux.butlerInstallDirectory  | String | null | Set if you want to override the automatic Butler install directory on Linux |
| linux.binDirectory  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) The directory of your game's Linux build |
| linux.channel  | String | "linux" | The channel to release the Linux build to |
| anyOs.binDirectory  | String | _blank_ | (**required**) The directory of your game's Linux build |
| anyOs.channel  | String | "release" | The channel to release your cross-platform build to |

The following example shows all options in use.

```gradle
project(":projectName") {
   apply plugin: "org.mini2Dx.butler"
   
   ........

   butler {
      user = "your-itchio-user"
      game = "your-itchio-game"
      updateButler = true
      alphaChannel = false
      betaChannel = false
      userVersion = project.version

      //Windows-specific builds  
      //butlerInstallDirectory can be specified for anyOS builds performed on Windows 
      windows {
      	 butlerInstallDirectory = "C:\\path\to\butler\directory"
         binDirectory = "C:\\path\to\game\bin\directory"
         channel = "windows"
      }
      //OS X-specific builds.
      //butlerInstallDirectory can be specified for anyOS builds performed on OS X 
      osx {
         butlerInstallDirectory = "/path/to/butler/directory"
         binDirectory = "/path/to/game/bin/directory"
         channel = "osx"
      }
      //Linux-specific builds.
      //butlerInstallDirectory can be specified for anyOS builds performed on Linux
      linux {
         butlerInstallDirectory = "/path/to/butler/directory"
         binDirectory = "/path/to/game/bin/directory"
         channel = "linux"
      }
      //Cross-platform builds, e.g. HTML5 games
      anyOs {
      	 binDirectory = "C:\\path\to\game\bin\directory"
         channel = "release"
      }
   }
}
```
